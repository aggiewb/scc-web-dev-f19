'''
This is a program that will contain three classes: Grade, Student, and
Display.

The Grade class contains the class name, the credits and the grade point
(from 0 to 4) for the grade.

The Student class contains the students name and id number and a list of
grade objects. It has methods to enter the name and id, and a method to
calculate a GPA.

The Display class allows you to enter the information into the Grade and
Student classes and then displays the student name, student id, and their GPA.
