This is a program that contains a class called "area", that takes in two
parameters "side1", and "side2".  The measurements are in feet. Inside the
class there is a function that calculates the total area by multiplying side1
and side2. There is also function that returns the total area and a __str__
function that returns "The total area is " + [area in square feet] (put your
variable here). In the main function, the class will be called, which prints
the string.
