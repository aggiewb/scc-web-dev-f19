        <p>Hi! My name is Aggie, and I really love traveling. It's a great way to learn about myself, learn about the world I live in, and get out of my daily routine.</p>
        <p>I have visited many places so far. Some of the places I have visited include Japan, Spain, Austin, TX, and the Grand Canyon. Please visit my about page where I can give you some tips and links to help you travel.
        </p>
