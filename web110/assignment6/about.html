        <h1>About our family</h1>
        <p>About 100 million years go, we started our restaurant in a small shack in the Fremont area. Thousands of years later, our team and location have grown, but we maintain the same cozy feel as our shack. Here at Omnomnomnivore we care about all type of dinosaurs from all kinds of backgrounds. Our focus is that you are able to break bread with your family and friends.</p>
